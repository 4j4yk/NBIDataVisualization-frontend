<h6 class=centered-form><b>NBI Data Summary</b></h6>
<div>
<p>
  National Bridge Inventory is a database compiled by the Federal Highway
Administration every year. It is composed of information of United States bridges or
culverts that carry traffic and are longer than 20 feet. For the 2008 edition of the NBI,
there are 717,902 records, and 591,605 of which are qualified for highway bridges based
on the criterion of type of service on bridge and the National Bridge Inspection Standards
(NBIS) bridge length.
</p>
<p>
Each NBI bridge record contains 116 item attributes. The large number of attributes
makes exploratory data analysis a more appealing method for data analysis than
traditional statistical analysis. Some of the characteristics used to describe bridges include
age, location, materials and deck width. Other parts indicates operational conditions
including year build, type of services provided, rehabilitation year, average daily traffic,
as well as information regarding to bypass and detours. The rest are conditions and
appraisal ratings assigned by inspectors for each bridge in the database.
According to the NBIS, condition ratings are used to describe the current condition of
bridges or culverts. It assesses the physical condition of deck, superstructure and
substructure. The ratings range from 0 - for a failed condition to 9 - for an excellent
condition. The appraisal ratings, however, reveal serviceability and safety of the structure.
</p>
<p>
The evaluation includes field condition, waterway adequacy, geometric and safety
configurations, structural evaluation as well as safe load capacity of the bridge.
These conditions and appraisal ratings can be used for the classification of a bridge as
functionally obsolete or structurally deficient.If a bridge is classified as structurally
deficient with the condition ratings lower than 5, it implies the bridge may need further
analysis and even require maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement. However, if a
bridge is classified as functionally obsolete, it reveals only that the inadequacy of the
bridgeâ€˜s performance with respect to the transportation system.
